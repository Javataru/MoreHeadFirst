THE PREFACE. 

[Being an extract from a long and animated correspond- 
ence with a friend in America.] 

I QUITE recognise the force of your objection 
that an invalid or a woman in weak health would 
get no good from stories which attempt to treat 
some features of medical life with a certain amount 
of realism. If you deal with this life at all, how- 
ever, and if you are anxious to make your doc- 
tors something more than marionettes, it is quite 
essential that you should paint the darker side, 
since it is that which is principally presented to 
the surgeon or physician. He sees many beau- 
tiful things, it is true, fortitude and heroism, love 
and self-sacrifice ; but they are all called forth (as 
our nobler qualities are always called forth) by 
bitter sorrow and trial. One cannot write of 
medical life and be merry over it. 

Then why write of it, you may ask ? If a sub- 
ject is painful why treat it at all ? I answer that 
it is the province of fiction to treat painful things 

(ili) 



iv THE PREFACE. 

as well as cheerful ones. The story which wiles 
away a weary hour fulfils an obviously good pur- 
pose, but not more so, I hold, than that which 
helps to emphasise the graver side of life. A tale 
which may startle the reader out of his usual 
grooves of thought, and shocks him into serious- 
ness, plays the part of the alterative and tonic in 
medicine, bitter to the taste but bracing in the 
result. There are a few stories in this little col- 
lection which might have such an effect, and I 
have so far shared in your feeling that I have 
reserved them from serial publication. In book- 
form the reader can see that they are medical 
stories, and can, if he or she be so minded, avoid 

them. 

Yours very truly, 

A. CoNAN Doyle. 



P. S. — You ask about the Red Lamp. It is 
the usual sign of the general practitioner in Eng- 
land.

ROUND THE RED LAMP. .. 






BEHIND THE TIMES. ' : 

My first interview with Dr. James Winter 
was under dramatic circumstances. It occurred 
at two in the morning in the bedroom of an old 
country house. I kicked him twice on the white 
waistcoat and knocked off his gold spectacles, 
while he with the aid of a female accomplice 
stifled my angry cries in a flannel petticoat and 
thrust me into a warm bath. I am told that one 
of my parents, who happened to be present, re- 
marked in a whisper that there was nothing the 
matter with my lungs. I cannot recall how 
Dr. Winter looked at the time, for I had other 
things to think of, but his description of my own 
appearance is far from flattering. A fluffy head, 
a body like a trussed goose, very bandy legs, and 
feet with the soles turned inwards — those are the 
main items which he can remember. 

From this time onwards the epochs of my life 
were the periodical assaults which Dr. Winter

and tell him that I should be obliged to him if he 
would step round ? " 

She was back with an answer presently. "Dr. 
Winter will come round in an hour or so, sir ; but 
he has just been called in to attend Dr. Patter- 
son." 






HIS FIRST OPERATION. 

It was the first day of the winter session, and 
the third year's man was walking with the first 
year's man. Twelve o'clock was just booming out 
from the Tron Church. 

* ' Let me see, " said the third year's man. ' ' You 
have never seen an operation ? " 

^' Never." 

" Then this way, please. This is Rutherford's 
historic bar. A glass of sherry, please, for this 
gentleman. You are rather sensitive, are you 
not?" 

*' My nerves are not very strong, I am afraid." 

" Hum ! Another glass of sherry for this gen- 
tleman. We are going to an operation now, you 
know." 

The novice squared his shoulders and made a 
gallant attempt to look unconcerned. 

" Nothing very bad — eh ? " 

*' Well, yes — pretty bad." 

" An — an amputation ? " 

" No ; it's a bigger affair than that."

A STRAGGLER OF '15. 

It was a dull October morning, and heavy, 
I rolling fog-wreaths lay low over the wet grey 
roofs of the Woolwich houses. Down in the long, 
brick-lined streets all was sodden and greasy and 
cheerless. From the high dark buildings of the 
arsenal came the whirr of many wheels, the thud- 
ding of weights, and the buzz and babel of human 
toil. Beyond, the dwellings of the workingmen, 
smoke-stained and unlovely, radiated away in a 
lessening perspective of narrowing road and dwin- 
dling wall. 

There were few folk in the streets, for the toil- 
ers had all been absorbed since break of day by the 
huge smoke-spouting monster, which sucked in the 
manhood of the town, to belch it forth weary and 
work-stained every night. Little groups of chil- 
dren straggled to school, or loitered to peep through 
the single, front windows at the big, gilt-edged 
Bibles, balanced upon small, three-legged tables, 
which were their usual adornment. Stout women, 
with thick, red arms and dirty aprons, stood upon

^^ Missus Simpson, Missas Simpson!" cried i 
cracked and querulous voice from above. 

"That's him!" she cried, nodding her hea( 
with an air of triumph. "He do go on somethin 
scandalous. Yes, Mr. Brewster, sir." 

"I want my morning ration, Missus Simpson.' 

"It's just ready, Mr. Brewster, sir." 

"Blessed if he ain't like a baby cryin' for iti 
pap," said the young woman. 

"I feel as if I could shake his old bones uj 
sometimes ! " cried Mrs. Simpson viciously. "But 
who's for a 'arf of four penny ? " 

The whole company were about to shuffle ofl 
to the public house, when a young girl stepped 
across the road and touched the housekeeper tim- 
idly upon the arm. "I think that is No. 56 
Arsenal View," she said. "Can you tell me U 
Mr. Brewster lives here ? " 

The housekeei)er looked critically at the new- 
comer. She was a girl of about twenty, broad- 
faced and comely, with a tumed-up nose and large, 
honest grey eyes. Her print dress, her straw hat, 
with its bunch of glaring poppies, and the bundle 
she carried, had all a smack of the country. 

"You're Norah Brewster, I s'pose," said Mrs. 
Simpson, eyeing her up and down with no friendly 
gaze. 

"Yes, Fve come to look after my Granduncle 
Gregory."

" Have you read that ? " he asked, jerking his 
head towards the cutting. 

" Yes, uncle, and I'm sure you must be proud 
of it." 

" Ah, it was a great day for me } A great day ! 
The Regent was there, and a fine body of a man 
too ! ' The ridgment is proud of you,' says he. 
'And I'm proud of the ridgment,' say I. 'A

and they both bu'st out a-laughin'. But what be

"Oh, uncle, here's a regiment of soldiers com-

and his bony yellow fingers, like the claws of some 

j fierce old bird, dug into her shoulder. 

"They don't seem to have no number, uncle. 
They've something wrote on their shoulders. Ox- 
fordshire, I think it be." 

''Ah, yes! "he growled. "I heard as they'd 
dropped the numbers and given them newfangled 
names. There they go, by Jimini! They're 
young mostly, but they hain't forgot how to 
march. They have the swing — aye, I'll say that 
for them. They've got the swing." He gazed

"Eh, but it's fine! This sunshine makes me 
think o' the glory to come. You might read me a 
bit o' the Bible, lass. I find it wonderful sooth- 
ing." 

" What part would you like, uucle ? " 

''Oh, them wars.'' 

"The wars?" 

"Aye, keep to the wars! Give me the Old 
Testament for choice. There's more taste to it, to 
my mind. When parson comes he wants to get 
oflf to something else ; but it's Joshua or nothing 
with me. Them Israelites was good soldiers — 
good growed soldiers, all of em." 

"But, uncle," pleaded Norah, "it's all peace 
in the next world." 

"No, it ain't, gal." 

" Oh, yes, uncle, surely ! " 

The old corporal knocked his stick irritably 
upon the ground. ' ' I tell ye it ain' t, gal. I asked 
parson." 

" Well, what did he say ? " 

" He said there was to be a last fight. He even 
gave it a name, he did. The battle of Arm —

"Armageddon." 

"Aye, that's the name parson said. I 'specs 
the Third Guards'll be there. And the Dook — 
the Dook'll have a word to say."

blinking creature. He could not forgive it yet for 
that long night of misery. He caught sight of a 
white face in the bed and he ran towards it with 
such love and pity as his speech could find no 
words for. 

'' Thank God it is over ! Lucy, dear, it was 
dreadful ! " 

"But I'm so happy now. I never was so 
happy in my life." 

Her eyes were fixed upon the brown bundle. 

"You mustn't talk," said Mrs. Peyton. 

"But don't leave me," whispered his wife. 

So he sat in silence with his hand in hers. 
The lamp was burning dim and the first cold 
light of dawn was breaking through the window. 
The night had been long and dark but the day 
was the sweeter and the purer in consequence. 
London was wakiug up. The roar began to rise 
from the street. Lives had come and lives had 
gone, but the great machine was still working out 
its dim and tragic destiny.

SWEETHEARTS. 

^ \0 &lt;^ 

It is hard for the general practitioner who isles', 
among his patients both morning and evening, and- 
sees them in their homes between, to steal time 
for one little daily breath of cleanly air. To win 
it he must slip early from his bed and walk out 
between shuttered shops when it is chill but very 
clear, and all things are sharply outlined, as in a 
frost. It is an hour that has a charm of its own, 
when, but for a postman or a milkman, one has 
the pavement to oneself, and even the most com- 
mon thing takes an ever-recurring freshness, as 
though causeway, and lamp, and signboard had all 
wakened to the new day. Then even an inland 
city may seem beautiful, and bear virtue in its 
smoke- tain ted air. 

But it was by the sea that I lived, in a town 
that was unlovely enough were it not for its 
glorious neighbour. And who cares for the town 
when one can sit on the bench at the headland, 
and look out over the huge, blue bay, and the 
yellow scimitar that curves before it. I loved it

in his usual unemotional and somewhat pedantic 
fashion. "It is the assertion," he said, ''of the 
liberty of the individual cell as opposed to the 
cell-commune. It is the dissolution of a co-oper- 
ative society. The process is one of great inter- 
est." 

And so one grey morning his co-operative so- 
ciety dissolved. Very quietly and softly he sank 
into his eternal sleep. His two physicians felt 
some slight embarrassment when called upon to 
fill in his certificate. 

" It is difficult to give it a name," said one. 

"Very," said the other. 

"If he were not such an unemotional man, I 
should have said that he had died from some sud- 
den nervous shock—from, in fact, what the vul- 
gar would call a broken heart." 

"I don't think poor Grey was that sort of a 
man at all. " 

"Let us call it cardiac, anyhow," said the 
older physician. 

So they did so. 



A QUESTION OF DIPLOMACY. 173 

to his brougham. As he drove away, Lady Clara 
could see that he was already deeply absorbed in 
a paper-covered novel. 

She pushed back the velvet curtains, and re- 
turned into the drawing-room. Her daughter 
stood in the sunlight by the window, tall, fragile, 
and exquisite, her features and outline not unlike 
her mother's, but frailer, softer, more delicate. 
The golden light struck one half of her high-bred, 
sensitive face, and glimmered upon her thickly- 
coiled flaxen hair, striking a pinkish tint from 
her closely-cut costume of fawn-coloured cloth 
with its dainty cinnamon ruchings. One little 
soft frill of chiffon nestled round her throat, from 
which the white, graceful neck and well-poised 
head shot up like a lily amid moss. Her thin 
white hands were pressed together, and her blue 
eyes turned beseechingly upon her mother. 

'' Silly girl ! Silly girl ! " said the matron, an- 
swering that imploring look. She put her hands 
upon her daughter's sloping shoulders and drew 
her towards her. ''It is a very nice place for a 
short time. It will be a stepping stone. " 

'' But oh ! mamma, in a week ! Poor Arthur ! " 

' ' He will be happy. " 

" What ! happy to part ? " 

*' He need not part. You shall go with him." 

" Oh ! mamma ! " 

"Yes, I say it." 



A QUESTION OP DIPLOMACY. 177 

The medical baronet whirled round the cord 
of his pince-nez and pushed out a protesting 
hand. 

"No, no, but you must be firm on the point of 
Tangier.'* 

" Having deliberately formed the opinion that 
Tangier is the best place for our young patient, I 
do not think that I shall readily change my con- 
viction." 

" Of course not.** 

''I shall speak to Lord Charles upon the sub- 
ject now when I go upstairs." 

''Pray do." 

''And meanwhile she will continue her present 
course of treatment. I trust that the warm Afri- 
can air may send her back in a few months with 
all her energy restored." 

He bowed in the courteous, sweeping, old-world 
fashion which had done so much to build up his 
ten thousand a year, and, with the stealthy gait 
of a man whose life is spent in sick-rooms, he fol- 
lowed the footman upstairs. 

As the red velvet curtains swept back into 
position, the Lady Ida threw her arms round 
her mother's neck and sank her face on to her 

bosom. 

" Oh ! mamma, you are a diplomatist I " she 

cried. 

But her mother's expression was rather that

you remember what happened to Lord Bellamy's 
child. She was just Ida's age. That was another 
case in which Sir William's advice was disre- 
garded." 

Lord Charles groaned impatiently. 

" I have not disregarded it," said he. 

^'No, no, of course not. I know your strong 
sense, and your good heart too well, dear. You 
were very wisely looking at both sides of the 
question. That is what we poor women cannot 
do. It is emotion against reason, as I have often 
heard you say. We are swayed this way and 
that, but you men are persistent, and so you gain 
your way with us. But I am so pleased that you 
have decided for Tangier." 

*'HaveI?" 

"Well, dear, you said that you would not 
disregard Sir William." 

" Well, Clara, admitting that Ida is to go to 
Tangier, you will allow that it is impossible for 
me to escort her ? " 

"Utterly." 

"And for you?" 

" While you are ill my place is by your side." 

" There is your sister ? " 

" She is going to Florida." 

" Lady Dumbarton, then ? " 

"She is nursing her father. It is out of the 
question." 



182 ROUND THE RED LAMP. 

*'Well, then, whom can we possibly aski 
Especially just as the season is commencing. 
You see, Clara, the fates fight against Sir 
William." 

His wife rested her elbows against the back 
of the great red chair, and passed her fingers 
through the statesman's grizzled curls, stooping 
down as she did so until her lips were close to 
his ear. 

"There is Lord Arthur Sibthorpe," said she 
softly. 

Lord Charles bounded in his chair, and mut- 
tered a word or two such as were more fre- 
quently heard from Cabinet Ministers in Lord 
Melbourne's time than now. 

*'Are you mad, Clara!" he cried. ''What 
can have put such a thought into your head?" 

" The Prime Minister." 

' ' Who ? The Prime Minister ? " 

" Yes, dear. Now do, do be good ! Or per- 
haps I had better not speak to you about it any 
more." 

"Well, I really think that you have gone 
rather too far to retreat." 

"It was the Prime Minister, then, who told 
me that Lord Arthur was going to Tangier." 

" It is a fact, though it had escaped my mem- 
ory for the instant." 

"And then came Sir William with his advice

She stood silent and submissive, noting the quick 
play of thought which peeped from his eyes and 
lip. There was a sparkle in the one and a twitch 
of amusement in the other, as he af last glanced 
up at her. 

''Clara," said he, "deny it if you can! You 
have ordered the trousseau?'^ 

She gave his ear a little pinch. 

" Subject to your approval," said she. 

"You have written to the Archbishop." 

" It is not posted yet." 

"You have sent a note to Lord Arthur.'' 

" How could you tell that ? " 

"He is downstairs now." 

" No ; but I think that is his brougham." 

Lord Charles sank back with a look of half- 
comical despair. 

' ' Who is to fight against such a woman ? " he 
cried. "Oh! if I could send you to NovikoflE! 
He is too much for any of my men. But, Clara, 
I cannot have them up here." 

' ' Not for your blessing ? " 

"No, no!" 

" It would make them so happy." 

" I cannot stand scenes." 

" Then I shall convey it to them." 

"And pray say no more about it — to-day, at 
any rate. I have been weak over the matter." 

" Oh ! Charlie, you who are so strong ! " 



A QUESTION OF DIPLOMACY. 185 

" Ton have outflanked me, Clara. I., was very 
well done. I must congratulate you." 

"Well," she murmured, as she kissed him, 
'* you know I have been studying a very clever 
diplomatist for thirty years. "

A MEDICAL DOCUMENT. 

Medical men are, as a class, very much too 
busy to take stock of singular situations or dra- 
matic events. Thus it happens that the ablest 
chronicler of their experiences in our literature 
was a lawyer. A life spent in watching over 
death-beds — or over birth-beds which are infin- 
itely more trying — takes something from a man's 
sense of proportion, as constant strong waters 
might corrupt his palate. The overstimulated 
nerve ceases to respond. Ask the surgeon for his 
best experiences and he may reply that he has 
seen little that is remarkable, or break away into 
the technical. But catch him some night when 
the fire has spurted up and his pipe is reeking, 
with a few of his brother practitioners for com- 
pany and an artful question or allusion to set him 
going. Then you will get some raw, green facts 
new plucked from the tree of life. 

It is after one of the quarterly dinners of the 
Midland Branch of the British Medical Associ- 
ation. Twenty coffee cups, a dozen liqueur

glasses, and a solid bank of blue smoke which 
swirls slowly along the high, gilded ceiling gives 
a hint of a successful gathering. But the mem- 
bers have shredded off to their homes. The line 
of heavy, bulge-pocketed overcoats and of stetho- 
scope-bearing top hats is gone from the hotel cor- 
ridor. Round the fire in the sitting-room three 
medicos are still lingeriog, however, all smoking 
and arguing, while a fourth, who is a mere lay- 
man and young at that, sits back at the table. 
Under cover of an open journal he is writing furi- 
ously with a stylographic pen, asking a question 
in an innocent voice from time to time and so 
flickering up the conversation whenever it shows 
a tendency to wane. 

The three men are all of that staid middle age 
which begins early and lasts late in the profes- 
sion. They are none of them famous, yet each is 
of good repute, and a fair type of his particular 
branch. The portly man with the authoritative 
manner and the white, vitriol splash upon his 
cheek is Charley Manson, chief of the Wormley 
Asylum, and author of the brilliant monograph- 
Obscure Nervous Lesions in the Unmarried. He 
always wears his collar high like that, since the 
half-successful attempt of a student of Revela- 
tions to cut his throat with a splinter of glass. 
The second, with the ruddy face and the merry 
brown eyes, is a general practitioner, a man of

you had some ease in your mind. Foster.^ 

" Well, there was only one last week which 
was new to me. I had been engaged by some 
people of the name of Silcoe. When the trouble 
came round I went myself, for they would not 
hear of an assistant. The husband who was a 
policeman, was sitting at the head of the bed on 
the farther side. 'This won't do.' said I. "Oh 
yes, doctor, it must do,' said she. 'It's quite 
irregular and he must go,' said L • It's that or 
nothing,' said she. 'I won't open my mouth or 
stir a finger the whole night,' said he. So it 
ended by my allowing him to remain, and there 
he sat for eight hours on end. She was very 
good over the matter, but every now and again Tie 
would fetch a hollow groan, and I noticed that he 
held his right hand just under the sheet all the 
time, where I had no doubt that it was clasped 
by her left. When it was all hapfjily over, 1 
looked at him and his face was the colour of this 
cigar ash, and his head had dropped on to the 
edge of the pillow. Of course I thought he had 
fainted vnth emotion, and I was just telling my- 
self what I thought of myself for having been 
such a fool as to let him stay there, when sud- 
denly I saw that the sheet over his hand was all 
soaked with blood ; I whisked it down, and there 
was the fellow's wrist half cut through. TJio

'' Only taMng a note or two of your talk." 
The three medical men laugh as they walk 

towards their overcoats. 

''Why, we've done nothing but talk shop," 

says the general practitioner. ''What possible 

interest can the public take in that ? " 



LOT NO. 249. 

Of the dealings of Edward Bellingham with 
William Monkhouse Lee, and of the cause of the 
great terror of Abercrombie Smith, it may be that 
no absolute and final judgment will ever be deliv- 
ered. It is true that we have the full and clear 
narrative of Smith himself, and such corrobora- 
tion as he could look for ff©m Thomas Styles the 
servant, from the Reverend Plumptree Peterson, 
Fellow of Old's, and from such other people as 
chanced to gain some passing glance at this or 
that incident in a singular chain of events. Yet, 
in the main, the story must rest upon Smith 
alone, and the most will think that it is more 
likely that one brain, however outwardly sane, 
has some subtle warp in its texture, some strange 
flaw in its workings, than that the path of Nature 
has been overstepped in open day in so famed a 
centre of learning and light as the University of 
Oxford. Yet when we think how narrow and 
how devious this path of Nature is, how dimly 
we can trace it, for all our lamps of science, and

chap," said he. " What a prejudiced, green-eyed, 
evil- thinking old man it is ! You have really 
nothing against the fellow except that." 

"Well, Fve known her ever since she was as 
long as that cherry-wood pipe, and I don't like to 
see her taking risks. And it is a risk. He looks 
beastly. And he has a beastly temper, a venom- 
ous temper. You remember his row with Long 
Norton ? " 

"No; you always forget that I am a fresh- 
man." 

"Ah, it was last winter. Of course. Well, 
you know the towpath along by the river. There 
were several fellows going along it, Bellingham in 
front, when they came on an old market-woman 
coming the other way. It had been raining — yon 
know what those fields are like when it has rained 
— ^and the path ran between the river and a great 
puddle that was nearly as broad. Well, what 
does this swine do but keep the i)ath, and push 
the old girl into the mud, where she and her 
marketings came to terrible grief. It was a black- 
guard thing to do, and Long Norton, who is as 
gentle a fellow as ever stepped, told him what 
he thought of it. One word led to another, and 
it ended in Norton laying his stick across the 
fellow's shoulders. There was the deuce of a 
fuss about it, and it's a treat to see the way in 
which Bellingham looks at Norton when they

spent, they had reached the little cottage by the 
river. Young Lee, limp and dripping like a 
broken water-plant, was stretched upon the sofa, 
the green scum of the river upon his black hair, 
and a fringe of white foam upon his leaden-hued 
lips. Beside him knelt his fellow- student Har- 
rington, endeavouring to chafe some warmth back 
into his rigid limbs. 

*' I think there's life in him," said Smith, with 
his hand to the lad's side. "Put your watch 
glass to his lips. Yes, there's dimming on it. 
You take one arm, Hastie. Now work it as 1 do, 
and we'll soon pull him round." 

For ten minutes they worked in silence, inflat- 
ing and depressing the chest of the unconscious 
man. At the end of that time a shiver ran 
through his body, his lips trembled, and he 
opened his eyes. The three students burst out 
into an irrepressible cheer. 

"Wake up, old chap. You've frightened us 
quite enough." 

"Have some brandy. Take a sip from the 
flask." 

" He's all right now," said his companion Har- 
rington. " Heavens, what a fright I got ! I was 
reading here, and he had gone for a stroll as 
far as the river, when I heard a scream and a 
splash. Out I ran, and by the time that I could 
find him and fish him out, all life seemed to have 



LOT NO. 249. 247 

Smith saw it, and he could have knocked him 
down for it. 

'' You'll be sorrier still to hear that Monkhouse 
Lee is doing very well, and is out of all danger," 
he answered. "Your hellish tricks have not 
come off this time. Oh, you needn't try to brazen 
it out. I know all about it." 

Bellingham took a step back from the angry 
student, and half-closed the door as if to protect 
himself. 

"You are mad," he said. "What do you 
mean ? Do you assert that I had anything to do 
with Lee's accident ? " 

" Yes," thundered Smith. " You and that bag 
of bones behind you ; you worked it between you. 
I tell you what it is. Master B., they have given 
up burning folk like you, but we still keep a 
hangman, and, by George ! if any man in this col- 
lege meets his death while you are here, I'll have 
you up, and if you don't swing for it, it won't be 
my fault. You'll find that your filthy Egyptian 
tricks won't answer in England." 

"You're a raving lunatic," said Bellingham. 

"All right. You just remember what I 
say, for you'll find that I'll be better than my 
word. " 

The door slammed, and Smith went fuming up 
to his chamber, where he locked the door upon 
the inside, and spent half the night in smoking

thrown. Thank God, the door was ajar. He 
could see the thin bar of light which shot from 
the lamp in the hall. Nearer yet sounded the 
clatter from behind. He heard a hoarse gurgling 
at his very shoulder. With a shriek he flnng 
himself against the door, slammed and bolted it 
behind him, and sank half -fainting on to the hall 
chair. 

"My goodness. Smith, what's the matter?" 
asked Peterson, appearing at the door of his 
study. 

*' Give me some brandy ! " 

Peterson disappeared, and came rushing oat 
again with a glass and a decanter. 

" You need it," he said, as his visitor drank off 
what he poured out for him. "Why, man, you 
are as white as a cheese." 

Smith laid down his glass, rose up, and took a 
deep breath. 

" I am my own man again now," said he. *'I 
was never so unmanned before. But, with your 
leave, Peterson, I will sleep here to-night, for I 
don't think I could face that road again except by 
daylight. It's weak, I know, but I can't help it." 

Peterson looked at his visitor with a very 
questioning eye. 

"Of course you shall sleep here if you wish. 
I'll tell Mrs. Burney to make up the spare bed. 
Where are you off to now ? " 



256 ROUND THE RED LAMP. 

"My dear Smith, you are talking wildly. Let 
me beg you to go to bed." 

'' On the contrary, I never spoke so deliberately 
in my life. And I will promise to go to bed the 
moment you have signed it." 

''But what is it?" 

"It is a statement of all that I have been tell- 
ing you to-night. I wish you to witness it." 

"Certainly," said Peterson, signing his name 
under that of his companion. "There you aie! 
But what is the idea ? " 

"You will kindly retain it, and produce it in 
case I am arrested." 

' ' Arrested ? For what ? " 

" For murder. It is quite on the cards. I wish 
to be ready for every event. There is only one 
course open to me, and I am determined to 
take it." 

" For Heaven's sake, don't do anything rash ! " 

"Believe me, it would be far more rash to 
adopt any other course. I hope that we won't 
need to bother you, but it will ease my mind 
to know that you have this statement of my 
motives. And now I am ready to take your ad- 
vice and to go to roost, for I want to be at my 
be^t in the morning." 

Abercrombie Smith was not an entirely pleas- 
ant man to have as an enemy. Slow and easy-

his watch upon the table, drew out his pistol, 
cocked it, and laid it in his lap. Then he took 
the long amputating knife from his bosom, and 
threw it down in front of Bellingham. 

"Now, then," said he, "just get to work and 
cut up that mummy." 

"Oh, is that it?" said Bellingham with a 
sneer. 

" Yes, that is it. They tell me that the law 
can't touch you. But I have a law that will set 
matters straight. If in five minutes you have not 
set to work, I swear by the God. who made me 
that I will put a bullet through your brain ! " 

" You would murder me ? " 

Bellingham had half risen, and his face was 
the colour of putty. 

"Yes." 

" And for what ? " 

"To stop your mischief. One minute has 
gone. " 

"But what have I done ? " 

" I know and you know." 

"This is mere bullying." 

" Two minutes are gone." 

" But you must give reasons. You are a mad- 
man — a dangerous madman. Why should I de- 
stroy my own property ? It is a .valuable mum- 
my." 

" You must cut it up, and you must burn it."

pretty well drawn your teeth. You'll hear from 
me again, if you return to your old tricks. And 
now good-morning, for I must go back to my 
studies." 

And such is the narrative of Abercrombie 
Smith as to the singular events which occurred 
in Old College, Oxford, in the spring of '84. As 
Bellingham left the university immediately after- 
wards, and was last heard of in the Soudan, there 
is no one who can contradict his statement. But 
the wisdom of men is small, and the ways of 
nature are strange, and who shall put a bound to 
the dark things which may be found by those 
who seek for them ? 






THE LOS AMIGOS FIASCO. 

I USED to be the leading practitioner of Los 
Amigos. Of course, everyone has heard of the 
great electrical generating gear there. The town 
is wide spread, and there are dozens of little town- 
lets and villages all round, which receive their 
supply from the same centre, so that the works 
are on a very large scale. The Los Amigos folk 
say that they are the largest upon earth, but then 
we claim that for everything in Los Amigos ex- 
cept the gaol and the death-rate. Those are said 
to be the smallest. 

Now, with so fine an electrical supply, it 
seemed to be a sinful waste of hemp that the Los 
Amigos criminals should perish in the old-fashioned 
manner. And then came the news of the electro- 
cutions in the East, and how the results had not 
after all been so instantaneous as had been hoped. 
The Western Engineers raised their eyebrows 
when they read of the puny shocks by which 
these men had perished, and they vowed in Los 
Amigos that when an irreclaimable came their

months, that a weary sadness lurked always in 
the depths of his blue eyes, and that he was less 
concerned than ever with the eligible young ladies 
whom chance, or their careful country mammas, 
placed in his way. 



THE SURGEON TALKS. 307 

''And a doctor has very much to be thankful 
for also. Don't you ever forget it. It is such a 
pleasure to do a little good that a man should pay 
for the privilege instead of being paid for it. Still, 
of course, he has his home to keep up and his wife 
and children to support. But his patients are his 
friends — or they should be so. He goes from 
house to house, and his step and his voice are 
loved and welcomed in each. What could a man 
ask for more than that ? And besides, he is forced 
to be a good man. It is impossible for him to be 
anything else. How can a man spend his whole 
life in seeing suffering bravely borne and yet re- 
main a hard or a vicious man ? It is a noble, gen- 
erous, kindly profession, and you youngsters have 
got to see that it remains so."
